# 1001 Movies you must watch before dying

This is the current edition of the List, updated to include all films in all
editions of the 1001 Book, including films culled to make way for newer
releases. Some foreign films are listed with multiple titles, in English with
the original language title in parenthesis. Any films currently with wiki pages
will have links.  The order of the list is based upon the 2015 edition of the
1,001 Movies book, with the films removed from earlier editions being placed at
the end of their respective years.

A viewable and downloadable version of the list, complete with tracking columns
for which films have been reviewed by the 1,001 Movies You Must See Before You
Die Blog Club, and which films are available via Netflix, can be found here:
